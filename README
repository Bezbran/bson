TO USE:
Add bson.py to your project.

>> import bson
>>> a = bson.dumps({"A":[1,2,3,4,5,"6", u"7", {"C":u"DS"}]})
>>> b = bson.loads(a)
>>> b
{'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, '6', u'7', {'C': u'DS'}]}

Currently, bson.dumps() and bson.loads() expects everything to be documents, or
dicts in Python-speak.

TO INSTALL:
$ ./setup.py build
$ sudo ./setup.py install

TODO:
1. Make dumps() and loads() accept types other than documents/dicts.
2. Write doctests.
